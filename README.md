# Fullstack Template

This is a template repository for a fullstack application. This template provides you with a baseline application with a Java SpringBoot backend already set up with connection to a MySQL database and a NextJS frontend using Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.

## Setup
In order to set this template up follow these steps:
1. Create a new folder and type in this command:
   git clone https://github.com/HardBoss07/fullstack-java-nextjs-mysql.git
2. Install NextJS in the frontend folder:
   cd frontend
   npm install next@latest
3. Test the frontend:
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   Now visit localhost:3000
4. Create MySQL schema:
   In your MySQL Workbench create a new schema and a user (optional)

Now you should have fully set it up!
